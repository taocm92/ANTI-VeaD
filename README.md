# ANTI-VeaD

Analyses of the Attentional Networks Test for Interactions and Vigilance—executive and arousal components— with Distractors (ANTI-VeaD).

This project includes:
- One input: "Data_ANTI-VeaD.xlsx". This file is generated by E-Prime 2.0 and contains the scores of 117 participants in the ANTI-VeaD.
- Two scripts: 
  - (a) Data_Task_Treatment.R. This script generates five tables to analyse the effect of the task manipulation across its different conditions and trials. It also generates one table with the task indexes so as to be combined with the scores obtained in the self-reports.
  - (b) Task_Split-half.R. This script generates six tables with the reliability indexes for the type of trials in the ANTI-VeaD. These tables show each iteration conducted to obtain the permutation-based split-half reliability. The script also generates a file with a summary of the realiability and its Spearman-Brown correction for each index as well as an example to report this analysis.
